link:https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia[Hygieia] is a DevOps dashboarding project created by Capital One. This quickstart deploys Hygieia to OpenShift.

Setup commands:

TODOs:

- [ ] Add mongodb to applier inventory
- [ ] Get the UI to build using s2i. I'm thinking nodejs image -> deploy to nginx
- [ ] Look at how we build/deploy/configure collectors
