= Deploying Hygieia to OpenShift

link:https://github.com/Hygieia/Hygieia[Hygieia] is a DevOps dashboarding project created by Capital One. This quickstart deploys Hygieia to OpenShift.

== Setup Instructions

Install dependencies:

Deploy Hygieia, including creating a new namespace called `hygieia`:

----

If you would like to deploy to a different project:

----
ansible-playbook -i .applier/ galaxy/openshift-applier/playbooks/openshift-cluster-seed.yml -e filter_tags=all -e k8s_namespace=my-namespace

== Roadmap

TODOs:
